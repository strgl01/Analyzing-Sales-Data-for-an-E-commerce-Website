Project Summary<br>
    1. Data had 8 features and 541909 records<br>
    2. On analysing data we found for some records Unit Price column had 0 value and for same record Quantity column also had -ve value<br>
    3. On further analysis found the Description and Stock column were NAN, So we removed these records<br>
    4. Observed on sumation of Quantity column for each stock some stocks had -ve output which established some records were wrong as if something is not purchased how it can be returned. <br>
    5. For now i didn't considered these stocks as it was giving an ambiguous information<br>
    6. After doing all the cleaning now we had 9 features and 405595 records.<br>
    7. We created some features to help our analysis from existing columns like Quarter, Date, Total Price, etc<br>
    8. On the cleaned data we have performed both descripive and inferential statistics.<br>
